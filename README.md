# WeatherTopApp 

This is my web and programming assignment Weather Top App release 1+

* I have completed the items to release 1 plus singular elements from other releases (lt&lng, station deletion)
* I have a main, dashboard and about page.
* The Stations and readings appear as expected and are access via the dashboard access panel
* The latest readings are displaying on both the station and dashboard
* There are icons displaying on each parameter along with the required calcs up to release 1
* I did include single elements for 2 & 3 i.e. Lat & longitude, ability to delete both stations and readings
